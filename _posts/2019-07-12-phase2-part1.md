title: "Coding Phase 2 - Part 1"

I spent the whole day removing a component which I shouldn't have been doing,
so left annoyed I thought might as well write the blog, so here I am.

## Progress till now

In Phase 1, I sucessfully completed providing support for bears to define their
actions and also implemented two actions for `GitCommitBear`: `AddNewlineAction` and
`EditCommitMessageAction`. Here's a little demo of them in action (pun not intended).

Beware, clicking on this will redirect you. I couldn't figure out how to play it here itself.
If you know how to do it, [tell me](https://gitter.im/akshatkarani).

While working on this I came across an interesting bug in `color_letter` function in `ConsoleInteraction` module.
This function basically beautifies action names when they get printed on screen. The interesting thing about this was its implementation choice and the fact that no one caught this bug before. Explaining this bug will take a lot of time, if interested have a look [here](https://github.com/coala/coala/issues/6034).

After this I also wrote a tutorial which will help write bear specific actions.

## What's next?

I have been working on next part of the project which is providing support for bears to suggest multiple patches. For this I have added a new attribute to `Result` class, `alternated_diffs`. It is a list of dictionary, where each element is a alternate patch. And for each of these alternate patch an instance of `AlternatePatchAction` is added. This solution is a little hackish but it works, and I don't think there is any other way to do this without making huge changes to the core which is not worth it. I still have to test this and make some minor changes, and I also need content to write for the second blog so see you there.
