title: "Community Bonding Period"
---

Bonding period, as the name suggests is the time for the students to bond with the organisation and mentors. Having contributed since quite a few months I was already familiar with the working of coala as an organization, so I didn't have much to do during this period.
I spent most of my time planning, creating milestones and writing a [cEP](https://github.com/coala/cEPs/pull/182). cEP-coala Enhancement Proposal, where I basically had to write whatever I had written in my proposal. I was not fun.

Ideally I would have liked to have [@Makman2](https://github.com/Makman2) as my mentor but so would have all the other students. But sadly he does not have any time to mentor a project. My project has three mentors [@Vamshi99](https://github.com/Vamshi99), [@kriti21](https://github.com/kriti21) and [@abhishalya](https://github.com/abhishalya). Vamshi and kriti are previous year GSoC students, and abhishalya is a GCI student.

## What do I have to do?

So basically my project is about changing how actions work in coala. What are actions you ask? Action basically means the action to be taken on a result. What is result now? Result is nothing but the "result" of the analysis that coala performs. Currently there are only a set of actions that can be taken on a result. I have to change the action system so that people can define their own actions to be taken on a result. This part, I have figured out. I have to change existing result and action classes, write tests and update documentation for this.

Second part involves providing supporting bears which can give multiple fixes for a problem, which is currently not supported. This part might turn out to be little tricky, only because I don't have a detailed plan for it. Bonding periods ends in couple of days, and I have to come up with a detailed implementation for this. So I will stop writing now and try to figure this thing out.
